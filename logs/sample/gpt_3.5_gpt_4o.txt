Based on your interests, I recommend checking out 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of deep learning and its applications. If you're looking for something more introductory, you might enjoy 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach' by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. Both books are highly rated and cover a wide range of topics in AI. Would you like me to provide more recommendations or explain any specific concepts in AI?"

First, can you verify when you last successfully logged in? Also, have you received any error messages? This will help me better understand your situation and provide the most appropriate solution. In the meantime, I can see that there have been multiple failed login attempts from an unrecognized IP address, which triggered our security protocol. I can help you reset your access now if you'd like."

Assistant: Here's a solution to reverse a linked list in Python: class ListNode: def __init__(self, val=0, next=None): self.val = val self.next = next def reverseList(head): prev = None current = head while current is not None: next_temp = current.next current.next = prev prev = current current = next_temp return prev This implementation uses an iterative approach with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. Would you like me to explain how it works step by step? I can also show you a recursive solution if you prefer."
